## Overview

Hi. I have a problem. An incessant need to automate everything. 

> "Normally, if given the choice between doing something and nothing, I’d choose to do nothing. But I will do something if it helps someone else do nothing. I’d work all night, if it meant nothing got done." - Ron Swanson

Anyway, this repo contains everything to configure my workflow.

## Zsh

Install zsh with Oh My Zsh, Starship prompt, and plugins:
